==== Version 1.0.16 (tag: map_v1_0_16) ====

map.comp.deviceConfigRegistry bean is now configured via the 
comp.device.config.classpath property in map-component.properties.

Now depends on wl-core-component 1.0.14.

==== Version 1.0.15 (tag: map_v1_0_15) ====

Added au.com.sensis.mobile.web.component.map.device.xsd and now
depends on wl-build-scripts 1.0.7 for device-config-xjc target and 
wl-core-component 1.0.13 for related JAXB classes.

Added JAXB classes and xjb files generated by the device-config-xjc target.

Added new MapDeviceConfigRegistry class and injected it into the
MapDelegateImpl. device-config.xml configures whether MapDelegateImpl
will retrieve the server side map (defaults to yes).

==== Version 1.0.14 (tag: map_v1_0_14) ====

Updated to Yoanes' latest JavaScript from the devhome project.

==== Version 1.0.13 (tag: map_v1_0_13) ====

Initial zoom level for the hi end JavaScript maps (set up in setup.tag) now correctly
uses the EMS zoom level instead of the Mobiles zoom level.

==== Version 1.0.12 (tag: map_v1_0_12) ====

MapDelegate methods for obtaining a map of a location, now accept a MobilesIconType.

==== Version 1.0.11 (tag: map_v1_0_11) ====

Added MapLayer support to MapDelegate. Added photo/map layer toggle button to
render tag. Updated map controls to latest mimgs from WhereisMobile (and new
images in the imageserver project: imageserver/common/icons/mapControl).
Also now supports the faded zoom in/out image when the max/min levels are reached.

==== Version 1.0.10 (tag: map_v1_0_10) ====

Heavy refactoring of MapDelegate interface and the classes behind it. Some of this based on WhereisMobile.
Notable changes:
- MapDelegate now accepts a WGS84Point instead of a GeocodedAddress, as per WhereisMobile.
- Replaced MapResult with new MapUrlHolder interface.
- MapDelegateImpl no longer depends on the LocationManager that was inherited from WhitePagesMobile.
- The screen dimensions calculation of the device has been encapsulated behind a ScreenDimensionsStrategy
  interface. This may change in future once the real requirements become apparent.
- Fixed a bug inherited from WhitePagesMobile where panning the map moves the "centre" icon to the new centre. 
  The new implementation has been based on WhereisMobile. This relies on passing the original centre coordinate
  down to the EMSManager, whilst the new centre is encapsulated in the PanZoomDetail.
  
Also upgraded sdpCommon-manager to 1.0-059 in order to obtain new equals and hashCode methods on some
key model classes. 

==== Version 1.0.9 (tag: map_v1_0_9) ====

Upgraded to Yoanes' latest JavaScript from the devhome project.
Updated MCS mscr files to support Android-OS devices.

==== Version 1.0.8 (tag: map_v1_0_8) ====

Upgraded libs:
- sdpCommon-manager from 1.0-050 to 1.0-058.
- wl-core-component from 1.0.6 to 1.0.9.

==== Version 1.0.7 (tag: map_v1_0_7) ====

Fixed showcase bug introduced from previous release when 
publish artifact and showcase names were changed to start with "wl-" prefix.
Some config files were not updated accordingly.

==== Version 1.0.6 (tag: map_v1_0_6) ====

Deliverable from iteration 1.0.6 (and 1.0.5 since I skipped that tag) 
of the rockit Common UI project (http://jira.sensis.com.au/browse/CUI). 
These iterations focused mainly on stabilising the framework.

==== Version 1.0.4 (tag: map_v1_0_4) ====

Deliverable from iteration 1.0.4 of the rockit Common UI project 
(http://jira.sensis.com.au/browse/CUI). This iteration focused mainly 
on adding logging support to the current framework, adding a template
component and fixing up various other, smaller issues.

==== Version 1.0.3 (tag: map_v1_0_3) ====

Deliverable from iteration 1.0.3 of the rockit Common UI project 
(http://jira.sensis.com.au/browse/CUI). This iteration focused mainly 
on testing the current framework by prototyping the networknav and
map components and (locally) integrating them into WPM.

==== Version 1.0.1 (tag: v1_0_1) ====

Deliverable from iteration 1.0.1 of the rockit Common UI project 
(http://jira.sensis.com.au/browse/CUI). This iteration focused mainly 
on the project structure, testbed structure and build scripts. 
All build targets should work.

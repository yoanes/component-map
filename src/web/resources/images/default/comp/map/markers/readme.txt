This directory contains the large (standard) and small icons used by any web app that uses the map component (in mobilesComponents/map).
The png files are encoded, I used http://www.opinionatedgeek.com/dotnet/tools/Base64Encode/Default.aspx to encode the file.

The encoded icon is then added to the icon descriptions found in emsManagerContext.xml.
